# README - Thesis support sessions for STREEM students: Planning

This repository holds the slides and some small R code produced for a 45 minutes session on Planning for STREEM Master students. If interested in the source code for the slides, please contact me.

The R script holds the code to produce a simple GANTT chart. Feel free to find other planning tools online. But in case you are interested in learning some R in the process, go ahead and make your own planning using the script. The script reads in an excel file with data. The produced example GANTT can also be found in this repository.
